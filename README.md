         expiry_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
         FOREIGN KEY (location_id) REFERENCES locations(id)
     );

     CREATE TABLE weather_alerts (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

         user_id INT,
         min_temp DOUBLE,
         max_temp DOUBLE,
         weather_condition VARCHAR(50),
         FOREIGN KEY (location_id) REFERENCES locations(id),
         FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
     );

     CREATE TABLE notifications (

         user_id INT,
         location_id INT,
         message TEXT NOT NULL,
         created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
         is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
         FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
         FOREIGN KEY (location_id) REFERENCES locations(id)
     );
     ```
   - Update the database connection details in `ConnectionUtil.java`.

3. **Build the Project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Deploy to Tomcat**
   - Copy the generated `.war` file from the `target` directory to the `webapps` directory of your Tomcat installation.
   - Start Tomcat:
     ```bash
     ./startup.sh  # On Unix/Linux/Mac
     startup.bat   # On Windows
     ```

5. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/locationweb`

### Frontend Setup
- The frontend is bundled with the backend in the `war` file. No separate setup is required unless you want to modify the frontend independently:
  1. Install Node.js (optional for development).
  2. Install dependencies (if modifying):
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
  3. Modify JavaScript/CSS files as needed and rebuild the project.

## Application Flow
1. **User Authentication**
   - User registers or logs in.
   - Backend generates JWT and refresh token, stored in cookies and local storage, respectively.
   - JWT is validated for all protected routes via `JwtFilter`.

2. **Location Management**
   - User adds a location via geolocation or search.
   - Backend fetches address (Geoapify) and weather data (Open-Meteo), then saves to the database.
   - Locations are listed with real-time weather updates.

3. **Weather Integration**
   - Real-time weather is fetched on page load and updated periodically.
   - 7-day forecasts are cached for 24 hours and updated as needed.

4. **Route Planning**
   - User selects locations and transport mode.
   - Backend uses OpenRouteService to calculate the route, which is displayed on the map.

5. **Weather Alerts**
   - User sets alert conditions.
   - A scheduled task checks weather conditions hourly and generates notifications if conditions are met.

6. **Sharing**
   - User generates a share link.
   - Backend creates a temporary token, valid for 24 hours, linked to the location.

---

## Database Schema
- **users**: Stores user credentials.
- **locations**: Stores user-saved locations with weather and metadata.
- **refresh_tokens**: Stores refresh tokens for session management.
- **shared_locations**: Stores temporary sharing tokens for locations.
- **weather_alerts**: Stores user-defined weather alert conditions.
- **notifications**: Stores notifications for weather alerts and other events.

---

## Security
- **JWT Authentication**: All protected endpoints require a valid JWT, validated by `JwtFilter`.
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using BCrypt.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived refresh tokens are stored securely in the database and local storage.
- **CSRF Protection**: Implicitly handled by JWT and cookie-based authentication.
- **Input Validation**: Frontend and backend validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **HTTPS**: Recommended for production to secure data in transit.
